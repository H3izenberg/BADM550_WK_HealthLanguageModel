Right axis deviation and T-wave inversions are also consistent. 4) Extracardiac clues (less specific but supportive): Hoarseness (potential laryngeal infiltration), mild LFT elevation (congestion or infiltration). 5) Exclusion of alternatives: Negative HCM genetic testing makes typical sarcomeric HCM less likely. The low voltage ECG argues against both typical HCM and hypertensive heart disease. Lack of typical features makes sarcoidosis or Fabry disease less probable. Given the patient's age (54) and pending light chain results, ATTR amyloidosis (either wild-type or hereditary) is statistically more likely than AL amyloidosis, although AL must be urgently ruled out.\"\n",

Multiple empiric and targeted antibiotic courses (Doxycycline, Ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin) and a trial of Prednisone have failed to provide sustained resolution. Currently admitted with persistent fever despite recent Ciprofloxacin; now receiving Amoxicillin for *E. faecalis*. PMH notable for HTN, HLD, CAD s/p PCI, GERD, s/p Cholecystectomy.
