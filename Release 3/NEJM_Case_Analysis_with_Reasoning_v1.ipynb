Patient has had multiple admissions with trials of doxycycline, prednisone, and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Prior liver drain culture grew K. pneumoniae; recent liver biopsy (1 mo ago) showed abscess and grew E. coli. Current admission liver aspirate grew E. faecalis. PMH significant for HTN, HLD, CAD s/p PCI x3 (12 yrs ago), hiatal hernia, GERD. PSH includes cholecystectomy (9 yrs ago) and PCI. Baseline meds include rosuvastatin, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, multivitamin. NKDA. FH includes siblings with ITP, psoriasis, granuloma annulare, chronic pancreatitis; son with iritis; no FHx of frequent infections. SH: Retired (food service), lives with wife, pets (cats, finches). Veteran (SE Asia 5 decades ago), US SW/SE travel 2 yrs ago. Lifelong non-smoker, no ETOH/drugs. ROS positive for fatigue, possible mild weight loss; negative for cough, SOB. Exam notable for epigastric tenderness and splenomegaly. Recent CT showed stable pulmonary nodules, worsening hepato-splenic lesions, splenomegaly (15cm), new interstitial pulmonary edema. EGD showed portal hypertensive gastropathy. Labs show mild leukocytosis (WBC 5.2K), persistent anemia (Hb 11.4), elevated Alk Phos (577). Patient started on amoxicillin based on recent E. faecalis growth from liver aspirate. Plan to monitor response to therapy and continue diagnostic workup for underlying etiology.\"\n",
