You are a medical expert. Consider the following patient presentation. Do a differential diagnosis.

<patient_presentation> A 41-year-old man was evaluated for swelling in the ankles and syncope. CT of the chest showed bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, as well as an 8-mm nodule in the right lower lobe. </patient_presentation>

Below is a list of potential diagnoses (“differential diagnosis”) for this 41‐year‐old man based on his presentation with ankle swelling, syncope, and CT findings of bilateral mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy plus a small (8‐mm) right lower lobe nodule. Each possibility is supported by some of the findings, although additional history, physical exam details, and further testing would be needed to reach a definitive diagnosis.  
   
1. Sarcoidosis (with potential cardiac involvement)    
 • Explanation: Sarcoidosis is classically associated with bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and may also feature pulmonary nodules or granulomas. In many patients (especially in those 20–50 years old), the lungs are involved, and the nodules often follow a perilymphatic distribution. Importantly, when sarcoidosis involves the heart, it can cause conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, or cardiomyopathy. These cardiac sequelae can lead to symptoms such as syncope and peripheral edema (which might explain the ankle swelling).    
 • Next steps: An ECG, echocardiogram, or even cardiac MRI could help assess for cardiac granulomas or conduction disturbances; tissue biopsy (e.g., of an accessible lymph node) demonstrating noncaseating granulomas would support the diagnosis.  
   
2. Hodgkin Lymphoma (or other lymphoma)    
 • Explanation: Lymphomas, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma, can present with prominent mediastinal (and hilar) adenopathy. Although an 8‐mm lung nodule is not a typical isolated finding in lymphoma, extranodal involvement may rarely occur. Other systemic “B symptoms” (fever, night sweats, weight loss) are common in lymphoma, although they are not described in this case. Compression of mediastinal structures can sometimes be associated with syncopal events, but this is less common than in cardiac causes.    
 • Next steps: Laboratory evaluation (including complete blood counts, inflammatory markers), PET imaging, and ultimately a tissue biopsy from an accessible lymph node could be useful in clarifying this possibility.  
   
3. Infectious Granulomatous Diseases    
 A. Tuberculosis (TB)    
  • Explanation: TB can cause lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules (such as a Ghon focus), and sometimes the pattern mimics sarcoidosis. However, TB more often presents with systemic symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight loss) and typically favors the upper lobes on imaging in reactivation disease. Primary TB can involve mediastinal nodes, particularly in younger patients.    
  • Next steps: Tuberculin skin testing or interferon-gamma release assays, sputum studies (if cough is present), and possibly tissue sampling would help exclude TB.    
 B. Fungal Infections (e.g., Histoplasmosis or Coccidioidomycosis)    
  • Explanation: In endemic areas, certain fungal infections can produce bilateral lymphadenopathy and nodular lung lesions that might mimic sarcoidosis.    
  • Next steps: Serologic testing, fungal cultures, and possibly biopsy with special stains might be indicated based on the clinical context.  
   
4. Chronic Beryllium Disease    
 • Explanation: This condition produces a clinical and radiologic picture that is nearly indistinguishable from sarcoidosis (bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, pulmonary nodules) but is related to exposure to beryllium (commonly in certain industrial settings).    
 • Next steps: A detailed occupational history is critical, and specific lymphocyte proliferation testing may help differentiate it from sarcoidosis.  
   
Summary and Approach:    
• The combination of bilateral hilar/mediastinal adenopathy and a lung nodule most classically suggests sarcoidosis. The patient’s symptoms of syncope and ankle swelling raise concern for cardiac involvement (which in sarcoidosis can lead to conduction system disease or heart failure). This makes cardiac sarcoidosis a leading contender.    
• However, lymphoma and certain infectious or occupational etiologies must be considered (and ruled out) through further evaluation—ideally starting with a careful history (including occupational and exposure history), physical evaluation for other systemic signs, cardiac work-up (EKG/echo), and obtaining tissue for definitive histopathologic diagnosis.  
   
It is important to note that while sarcoidosis is high on the list given the radiographic pattern and possible cardiac manifestations, additional work-up is necessary to exclude other serious conditions such as lymphoma or infections. A multidisciplinary approach including pulmonology, cardiology, and potentially oncology or infectious disease specialists is advisable to clarify the diagnosis and guide management.
