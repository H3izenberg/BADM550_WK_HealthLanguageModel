Initial symptoms included nausea, myalgias, chills, vomiting, neck pain, and photophobia, followed by confusion, dyspnea, and worsening headache. Examination showed respiratory distress, meningismus, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and a new holosystolic murmur. Imaging revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage, cortical infarcts, pulmonary opacities, and splenic hypodensities. Laboratory findings indicated leukocytosis, elevated d-dimer, and protein abnormalities. CSF analysis showed neutrophilic pleocytosis and elevated opening pressure. The patient was empirically treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials and supportive care.",
